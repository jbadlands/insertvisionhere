		Create and participate in opiniated discussions.

	<p class="body_text">
		Welcome to the new way to discuss topics online. The idea behind [insert vision here] is for you to <strong>make a statement</strong> (proposition) and <strong>argue your point.</strong> You won't be able to learn other peoples opinions until you have expressed your own, and because you only have one chance to make your point, you have to really <strong>think about it</strong> before becoming involved in the discussion.
	</p>
	
	<p class="body_text">
		<strong>Why?</strong> Forums and comment sections of blogs and popular sites like youtube tend to go off topic and often become battlegrounds for idiots. We let you <strong>embed videos and links</strong> into your propositions so you can easily get feedback on anything by inviting people to talk privately or opening the floor to the rest of the community.
